Testing and Sharing of Experimentation

This is a repository dedicated to the work I have Done on Large Language Models using the Langchain.

1. My First Application I have worked on is Chatbot using Langchain and OpenAI API and streamlit for deploying it in a web interface.
2. Then I worked on a ChatwithPdf application using Cohere LLM (through API), Cohere Embeddings for the documents, and FAISS Similarity Search.
3. In this iteration I modified the ChatwithPdf application to work offline using various Llama models.
4. Further, To reduce the redundant operations of vectorising documents, I explored various vectorstores and implemented a simple Chroma Vectorstore.
5. I have also reimplemented the ChatwithPDF with Langchain's ChromaDB integration and RetrievalQA chain.
6. I also looked into SentenceTransformerEmbedding,Text2VecEmbedding, CohereEmbedding, HuggingFaceEmbedding, InstructorEmbedding and MiniLM_L6_V2 Embeddings.
7. I have also looked into developing custom embeddings using Chroma's Custom Embedding Functions for developing embeddings that can vectorize tablular data too by making use of MET and SliceMyPdf
